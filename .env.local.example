# Local environment configuration
# Copy this to .env.local and customize for your needs

# Service deployment configuration
# List services you need REAL; everything else deploys as mocks
# All services always deploy - SERVICES_REAL only determines mode (real or mock)
#
# Common patterns:
#   SERVICES_REAL="api"                  # API development with database
#   SERVICES_REAL="frontend"             # Frontend work, backends mocked
#   SERVICES_REAL="frontend,backend,api" # Integration testing
#   SERVICES_REAL=""                     # All services mocked
#
SERVICES_REAL=""

# Optional: Enable database seeding (when database is deployed)
SEED_DATABASE=false
